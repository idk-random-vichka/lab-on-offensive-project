# currently, we can dns spoof M1 with any website
# however, if we try to spoof another machine that prefers https then we cannot
# unless we spoof an unsecure website that only runs on http
# on M1 other websites, do load but very slowly since all connections go through us
# on another machine only does that are http go thorugh us
